# Dream Doctor
The eminent psychologist, Carl Gustav Jung, believed that our dreams will reveal our most authentic selves. Dr. Jung used the dream's thematic and symbolic content to assess a patient's level of consciousness. Inspired by Dr. Jung's depth of insight and contribution to humanity, we created an AI version of Dr. Jung (using sophisticated maCHine learning algorithms), and coded it into our brand new application, Dream Doctor. Enter, and learn about your subconscious.
